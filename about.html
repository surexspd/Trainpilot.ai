                <p>We develop a web/mobile application. This AI-powered decision-support system helps train controllers make real-time, optimized decisions for train movements. It uses operations research to create schedules, minimizing delays and maximizing throughput, with a user-friendly interface.

An AI-powered decision-support system for train controllers can be developed by integrating operations research algorithms for schedule optimization with machine learning for real-time decision-making, paired with an intuitive interface for web and mobile platforms. These systems analyze live and historical data, provide actionable insights, and streamline train traffic while minimizing delays and maximizing throughput.
